    <h1>JavaScript: High-level Overview</h1>
    <p>
      JavaScript is a high-level, Object-oriented, Multi-paradigm Programming
      Language
    </p>
    <p>JavaScript is :</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>High-level</span> :In Low level languages (e.g. C), Developer has
        to manage resources manually. But in high-level languages(e.g. JS,
        Python), the developer doesnot have to worry about how to manage
        resources. JavaScript does it automatically.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Garbage-collected</span> Here JS removes old(unused) objects from
        memory automatically. So the developer don't have to manually clean up
        the memory.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Interpreted/JIT Compiled</span>:JS codes are converted into
        machine code entirely(with out storing portable files like c++ ) at once
        and then execute immediately.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Multi-paradigm</span> approach of structuring code. Js supports
        Procedural Programming(Linear programming), OOP and Functional
        Programming.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>prototype-based OO</span> Everything in JS is an object except
        primitive types. there is a prototype (Blueprint) that contains methods
        of objects. So when we write objects, it inherits the methods from the
        blueprint(prototype)
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>First-class functions</span> In a language of First-class
        functions, functions are simply treated as variables. We can pass them
        into other functions, and return from functions. Example of passing
        function into another function as argument: p.addEventlistener("click",
        displayMessage)
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Dynamically-typed language</span> No data type definitions. It is
        deterrmined at runtime. Data type is automatically changed(let x=="NN" x
        = 10).
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Single-threaded and Non-blocking event loop</span>
        Javascript uses event loop to handle concurrent tasks(multiple tasks
        happening at the sae time). Event loop takes long long runnig tasks,
        executes them in background, and puts them back in the main thread once
        they're finished.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Interpreted vs Compiled vs JIT-compiled</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Compiled </span> here the Entire code is converted into machine
        code at once. Then it keeps portable file and finally executes it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Interpreted </span>here code is converted to machine code line by
        line. It is much slower than compiled languages.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>JIT Compiled </span>
        here Entire code is converted into machine code (with out storing
        portable files like c++ ) at once and then execute immediately.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>JavaScript Engine</h2>
    <p>JavaScript Engine is a program that execute JavaScript code.</p>
    <p>E.g. V8 Engine</p>
    <p>Has 2 parts: Callstack and Heap</p>
    <p>Callstack : is where our codes are executed.</p>
    <p>Heap: is where objects are stored.</p>

    <h2>Modern JIT Compilation step of JavaScript</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <span>Parsing</span>: first the code is parsed into a data structure
        called AST(Abstract Syntax Structure or tree). Also checks if there is
        syntax error.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Compilation</span> the code will be converted to machine code with
        JIT.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Execution</span> the code will be executed. It happens in call
        Stack.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Optimization strategy</span> JavaScript first creates a very
        unoptimized version of machine code in the beginning to start executing
        as fast as possible. In the background, this code is optimized and
        recompiled during the already running prgram execution. It can be done
        multiple times.
      </li>
      <p>
        After each optimization, the unoptimized code is simply swapped by the
        optimized one without ever stopping execution. It makes modern engines
        (V8) fast.
      </p>
    </ol>
    <h2>JavaScript Runtime</h2>
    <p>
      is a container including all the things that we need to use
      JavaScript(e.g. Browser). Without engine, there is no runtime.
    </p>
    <p>JavaScript runtime includes Engine, Web API and Callback Queue.</p>
    <p>
      <span>JavaScript Engine</span>: is a program that executed JavaScript
      code.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Web API</span> : is functionality provied to the engine. It is
      outside of the browser but JS Engine access it on window object. It
      includes DOM, Fetch API, Timers...
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>CallBack queue</span> data structure containing all callback
      functions. Example: callback function from DOM event listener. When user
      clicks on a button, the callback function is put on callback queue in JS
      Engine. Then when the callstack is empty, the callback function is passed
      to the callstack so it can be executed. These all are handled by event
      loop. Basically, event loop takes callback functions from callback queue,
      and puts it to callstack for execution./p>
    </p>
    <h2>Execution Contexts and the call stack</h2>
    <p>Steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First it is compiled so it becomes ready to be executed</li>
      <li>
        <span>Creation of global execution content for top-level code</span>
        Top-level code is global or which is outside function. e.g const name =
        "Natty" declared globally. Execution context is an environment in which
        a piece of javascript is executed. It stores all the necessary
        information for some code to be executed. There is exactly one/default
        global execution content(EC) top-level code.
      </li>
      <li><span>Execution of top-level code (inside global EC)</span></li>
      <li>
        <span>Execution of functions and waiting for callbacks</span> For each
        function call, one new execution context is created.
      </li>
      <li>The all together make the call stack</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What's inside execution context</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <span>Variable environment</span>: - let, const, var declarations ,
        -functions, -argument object
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Scope chain</span>references to variables located outside the
        function
      </li>
      <li><span>this keyword</span></li>
      <p>Argument object and this keyword can't be in arrow functions</p>
    </ol>
    <h3>Call Stack explained</h3>
    <p>
      It is where our JavaScript codes are executed in javascript engine. When
      there are multiple functions(functions calling another functions),
      Execution contexts get stacked on top of each other, to keep track of
      where we are in the execution and which to execute next. The one on the
      top of the stack is the one currently running. Once it finishes execution,
      it will be out of the callstack and the previous will be execued. In
      JavaScript callstack, order of execution willnot be lost.
